# PScan
- CS50 final project [[Harverd edx]]

## Description
**PScan** is a powerful port scanning tool designed to provide comprehensive network analysis and security assessment. With its capabilities, PScan allows users to scan target systems for open/ filtered/close ports and identify potential vulnerabilities, making it an essential tool for network administrators, penetration testers.

Key Features of **PScan** :
1. *Port Discovery* : PScan employs a robust scanning engine that efficiently discovers open ports on target systems. By systematically scanning a range of ports, it provides valuable information about the services running on those ports, which aids in the identification of potential security risks.
2. *User-Friendly Interface* : PScan features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the scanning process. It offers both command-line and graphical user interface (GUI) options, allowing users to choose the interface that best suits their preferences and expertise.
3. *Scan Options* : PScan offers options to cater to different requirements. Users can perform default scan on specific ports (Top 20 most scanned ports in cybersecurity) or choose another option.

## Tools and libraries
The programing language used to implement this project is **Python**.
- *Socket* : python library that allows to send messages across a network.
- *Scapy* : powerful interactive packet manipulation library written in Python. Scapy is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies...
- *Customtkinter* :  is a python UI-library based on Tkinter, which provides new, modern and fully customizable widgets.
- *Colorama* : is a cross-platform library that simplifies the process of adding color to terminal text.
- *Pyfiglet* : it takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like  
the title above, which is the 'block' font).
